Extension for Stable Diffusion web-ui enables negative prompt in prompt.
This is a hack to make it work on the current sd-webui-forge backend. Possibly really fragile, as I don't really know what I'm doing.
** You may consider editing Line 141 to change `p.sd_model.text_processing_engine_g` to `p.sd_model.text_processing_engine_l`. It didn't have much of an effect in my testing, but give it a shot if it behaves unexpectedly. I also don't know if this line will work with SD1.5. If it doesn't, uncomment the `pprint(dir())` lines (restart the UI each time) to see the possible values to try. **

# Overview
This extension enhances the stable diffusion web-ui prompts and cross-attention, allowing for the use of prompts with negative effects within regular prompts and prompts with positive effects within negative prompts. Typically, unwanted elements are placed in negative prompts, but negative prompts may not always have a significant impact in calculations. With this extension, it becomes possible to use negative prompts with effects comparable to regular prompts. This enables stronger effects even for words that might have collapsed when their values were increased too much in negative prompts before, by incorporating negative effects into the prompts.

# Instructions
By checking the "Active" box, it will become effective. In the prompt input screen, entering a negative value like `(word:-1)` will give it a negative effect. It also works with negative prompts, in which case it will have a positive effect.

This was created with the prompt "gothic dress". Despite including `(black:1.8)` in the negative prompt, it's still black. It seems impossible to completely eliminate the blackness of word `gothic`.

Following image created using `(black:-1.8)` in the prompt with NegPiP. It's no longer black.

By the way, this is what happens when you don't use either NegPiP or negative prompts.

## Magical Dandy
Magical Dandy is a magical dandy. Summoning a magical dandy is very difficult. That's because it requires coexistence of a magical girl and a dandy. But the dandy is weak. The girl is strong. Very strong. So the dandy ends up losing. Even if you put `(girl:1.8)` in the negative prompt, it won't come up.

Therefore, it may be necessary to input `(girl:-1.6)` in the prompt to remove the girl.
